            <p>In late 2019, Sabay were looking to redesign their corporate website as it was, at that time, outdated
                and did not reflect the value and the company very well. I was assigned as a Development Lead to oversee
                the development of the website.</p>
            <p>In this project, I worked with a Lead Designer who designed the majority of the new Sabay website.</p>

            <h6 class="mt-5">Development</h6>
            <p>For this project, we decided to use Jekyll framework which was built using Ruby. We decided to use Jekyll
                because this corporate website is a simple static website with very few pages.</p>
