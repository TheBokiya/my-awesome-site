    <p>The name is Heng. Bodyka Heng. Tim Bodyka Heng. Too long? You have my permission to call me "Tim". I'm a UX/UI designer based in Vancouver. If you're here to get help on designing your restaurant's menu then I'm not the designer you're looking for. Yes, I enjoy playing video games. Yes, I watch tons of movies. Yes, I watch tons of TVs. Yes, I enjoy pop cultures. Well done, Sherlock! Well, I don't have to tell you anymore about me then. Look around, contact me if you like what you see.</p>

    <h1>What does that logo mean?</h1>
    <p>Logos are very hard to conceptualize and design. I've always wanted to have a logo that has a strong sense of identity. I wanted a logo that represent me because that's what logos are for.</p>
    <p>The three white pillars in the logo represents the three towers of <a href="http://www.angkorhotels.org/data/7/unknow_general/angkor-wat_720x295.jpg" target="_blank" class="underline">Angkor Wat</a> , also can be seen from the <a href="https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/images/k/kh.gif" target="_blank" class="underline">Cambodian flag</a> . Angkor Wat has five towers but if you stand right in front of the temple, you can only see towers.</p>
