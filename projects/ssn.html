            <p>Secure Settlement Network (SSN) is a open, neutral and secure payment authorization ledger; linking
                payment providers to merchants and customers.</p>
            <p>In this project, I was the Lead UI/UX Designer in charge of desgining the website as well as the Team
                Lead to oversee the development of the website.</p>

            <h6 class="mt-5">Design</h6>
            <p>The design process of this project began with a pen-and-paper wireframe to draft out the flow and
                user-experience of the site. We then tested out the wireframe with the stakeholders to make sure the
                navigation and the structure is how the stakeholders envisioned it to be.</p>
            <p>We then proceeded to draft the first version of the high-fidelity mockup of the site using Adobe XD. In
                this part of the process, we were able to decide on the color scheme and the overall look and feel for
                the site.</p>

            <h6 class="mt-5">Development</h6>
            <p>For this project, we decided to use Ruby on Rails' framework, Jekyll. This framework allows us to quickly
                transform the design from a high-fidelity mockup into a production-ready website. Becasue this is a very
                simple website with mainly static content, Jekyll proved to be the perfect choice for this project.</p>
